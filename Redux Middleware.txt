Redux Middleware

What I love about Redux middleware is it gives you the tools and lets you decide what you want to build with them. 
What I love about the JavaScript ecosystem is odds are, if you need something done, there's a package for it.

Here are some popular packages in the Redux ecosystem that are implemented via middleware.
