More Asynchronous Options

The most common requests I get for this course are around more advanced data fetching topics with Redux. 
I've resisted because typically they bring in a lot of complexity while the benefits aren't seen until 
your data fetching needs become large enough. With that said, 
now that you have a solid foundation on Redux and specifically, 
asynchronous Redux, you'll be in a good position to read up on the different options to decide 
if any would work best for the type of application you're working on. 
I encourage to read up on both of the other (popular) options.

Redux Promise - FSA-compliant promise middleware for Redux.

Redux Saga - An alternative side effect model for Redux apps
